# Docifer Evaluations

Evaluation run outputs are written locally under:

```text
evals/runs/<run-name>/
```

Each run contains:

- `results.jsonl`
- `summary.json`
- `report.md`
- `ragas_input.jsonl`

The `evals/runs/` directory is ignored by git because it contains generated local results and may include model outputs. Commit curated reports under `docs/` when a baseline needs to be preserved.
